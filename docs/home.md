This document contains info about `/app`

# At a glance
Shows status of api's commonly used in servers. Its a continued legacy from
old admintools to have API status listed somewhere, just here its moved
to the home page instead of a seperate status screen.

# Servers
You can add a server by clicking the "+" button at the top right of your 
screen. A popup will appear asking you for the servers details and 
credentials.

It will ask for
- Name, a nickname for your server that will appear as a title of its card
when its added. (maximum of 19 characters)
- Host, the adress of the RCON server. (maximum of 64 characters)
- Port, the port of the RCON server.
- Password, password of the RCON server.

After you have inputed the neccesary info the popup will dissapear and a card
of the server will appear.

## How do I connect to a server?
You connect to a server by clicking on the server card.

## Warning about (Name, Host, Password) too long
The app will warn you if something you inputed was too long and it had to be
trimmed to its size.
