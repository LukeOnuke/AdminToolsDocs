## Migrating from old admintools?
If you are migrating from the old AdminTools desktop program you should be
able to effortlessly use this app, as it takes a lot of what worked from
the old program.

## Documentation organisation
The docs are organised on a per page basis for easy learning. Each page of
the app has its own page on the documentation.

Only more advanced stuff like upcomming scripting will have its own page
even though its on a already existing app page.
